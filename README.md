- 🤖 Building skills in NLP, machine learning, automation, and visualization to turn data into actionable insights  

## 🛠️ Technical Skills

- **Programming Languages:** Python (favorite!), Java, SQL  
- **Python Libraries & Frameworks:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, VADER, NetworkX, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow (learning), PyTorch (learning)  
- **Data Science & Analytics:** Topic Modeling (LDA), Sentiment Analysis, Social Network Analysis, Anomaly Detection, Classification & Regression, Clustering  
- **Databases & Data Warehousing:** MySQL, SQLite, MySQL Workbench, Data Warehouse Design, ETL Pipelines  
- **Visualization & Dashboards:** Tableau, Streamlit, Plotly, Jupyter Notebooks  
- **Other Tools & Concepts:** Maven, JavaFX, Git, Automation  

## 🚧 Current Projects

- 📊 **Real-Time Bluesky Risk Monitor (ongoing)**  
  NLP-powered dashboard to track emerging risks from Bluesky posts, featuring sentiment and keyword analysis, built with Streamlit.

- 🧠 **Topic Modeling on University Discourse**  
  Explored how data processing steps impact LDA results and sentiment on Wikipedia entries about R1/R2 universities.

- 🔍 **Social Network Analytics on Political Tweets**  
  Performed large-scale social network analysis on 135,000+ tweets using Python and NetworkX to identify key communities, influential users, and sentiment dynamics during political events and crisis response.

- 🎮 **Java Adventure Game**  
  Developed a text-based adventure game in Java using JavaFX and Maven, focusing on object-oriented programming. It gives 90s vibes! 

- 🚗 **Java Car State Control System**  
  Built a modular car state control application in Java with comprehensive unit testing, emphasizing clean architecture, state management, and test-driven development.
